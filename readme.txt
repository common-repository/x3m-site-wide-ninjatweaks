Wordpress security Plugin

== Description ==

This will add site-wide tweaks to the FUNCTIONS.PHP of any wp-theme, and increases the security of a WordPress Site. 
The creation of this plugin was based on Webfactory's Ninja Security Plugin!

There is no setup or configuration screen on the current version, but it's easy enough to edit the plugin.
Supports WP Multisite installations


These are the tweaks:

Removes Wordpress 
META HEADER version info, so hackers can't find
 which version of WP is running! 

Replaces the login information
 so hackers will not know if the USERNAME or the PASSWORD was wrong! 

Disables the EDITING of Themes and Plugins by NON ADMIN users!

Removes 
WLW (Windows Live Writer) link is present in the header, 
which is only needed if Winodws Live Writer
needs to be used!


Please feel free to add your own tweaks.
If you do, please be so kind and leave a message at support!
